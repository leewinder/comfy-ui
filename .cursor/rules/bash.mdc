- Bash Scripting & Support Functions Standards
    - Safety First: All Bash scripts must begin with the shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash and include the robust set command: set -euo pipefail to ensure immediate exit on errors, failure for unset variables, and proper pipe failure handling.
    - Error Handling & Logging: All mission-critical commands must include a check for a successful exit status ($?) or use || exit 1. Scripts should provide clear, actionable logging messages (e.g., using echo with distinct prefixes) rather than silent execution.
    - Quoting & Variables: You must strictly enforce the use of double quotes around all variable expansions (e.g., "$my_variable") to prevent word splitting and globbing issues.
    - Portability & Readability: Prefer standard POSIX utilities (e.g., awk, sed) and avoid using non-standard Bash extensions where possible. Scripts must be clear and include comments explaining complex logic or unusual syntax.
    - Purpose & Scope: Bash scripts are exclusively for support functions (e.g., deployment, cleanup, lifecycle management). You must challenge any attempt to use Bash for business logic that should reside in an application layer.
